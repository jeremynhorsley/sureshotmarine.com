          <h2>Reliability-first marine electrical work — built on a proven diagnostic process.</h2>
          <p>
            Sure Shot Marine was built on one principle:
            <strong>electrical systems should be predictable, documented, and dependable.</strong>
            The goal is verified understanding — not guesswork.

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          I bring experience from mission-critical electrical environments — including U.S. Navy and Coast Guard settings —
          followed by complex energy systems commissioning and field diagnostics in the private sector.
          In those environments, electrical failures are not inconveniences. They are operational risks.
          That mindset shapes how I approach marine systems today.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before focusing on boats, my work centered on high-reliability infrastructure such as:
        </p>

        <ul class="clean">
          <li>AC and DC power distribution</li>
          <li>Battery systems and backup power</li>
          <li>Motor controls and critical loads</li>
          <li>Ground fault detection and fault isolation</li>
          <li>Power quality troubleshooting</li>
          <li>Monitoring, alarms, and controls</li>
          <li>Structured preventative maintenance programs</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h3>Why marine</h3>
        <p>
          Boats combine everything that makes electrical work hard: vibration, moisture, corrosion, limited access,
          mixed AC/DC systems, and years of add-on electronics layered over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most persistent issues aren’t caused by a single bad part — they come from incomplete installations,
          undocumented modifications, or small compromises that stack up.
          My job is to restore clarity and confidence to your system.
        </p>

        <h3>What clients can expect</h3>
        <ul class="clean">
          <li>Methodical troubleshooting with measured data</li>
          <li>Clean, ABYC-aligned workmanship</li>
          <li>Clear documentation of what was tested and what was found</li>
          <li>Practical recommendations, not upsells</li>
          <li>Long-term system thinking (stability first, then simplicity, then performance)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The name “Sure Shot”</h3>
        <p>
          In complex systems, guessing creates failures.
          Sure Shot represents precision, accountability, and doing the job correctly the first time —
          so when you leave the dock, your electrical system is not something you worry about.

      <h2>Electrical systems experience spanning three decades.</h2>
      <p>
        My technical work began in 1995 in the United States Navy, where disciplined troubleshooting,
        procedural accuracy, and system accountability were required standards.

    <h3>Education & Technical Foundation</h3>
    <p>
      I later completed a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering and have since worked
      in complex energy and power system environments involving commissioning,
      field diagnostics, and structured system validation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those environments require measured testing, clear documentation, and root-cause analysis —
      principles that now guide my marine electrical work.
    </p>

    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <p>
      Marine electrical systems deserve the same structured thinking applied to larger-scale
      power and energy infrastructure.
    </p>
    <ul class="clean">
      <li>Defined test procedures</li>
      <li>Measured data collection</li>
      <li>Documented findings</li>
      <li>Clear corrective recommendations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The objective is not part replacement. The objective is verified understanding.
    </p>

    <h3>Scope</h3>
    <p>
      Sure Shot Marine focuses specifically on electrical and onboard systems diagnostics.
      Mechanical engine repair, fiberglass work, and cosmetic projects are outside scope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specialization maintains technical accuracy and accountability.

        <p>
          Sure Shot Marine Systems was built on one principle:
          <strong>electrical systems should be predictable, documented, and dependable.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          I bring over three decades of experience working in mission-critical electrical environments — including
          service in both U.S. Navy and Coast Guard settings, followed by utility-scale energy system commissioning
          and troubleshooting in the private sector.
        </p>

        <p>
          In those environments, electrical failures are not inconveniences. They are operational risks.
          That mindset shapes everything I do today.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>
          Before focusing on marine systems, I supported high-reliability power infrastructure including:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>AC and DC power distribution systems</li>
          <li>Battery backup and energy storage systems</li>
          <li>Motor control and propulsion support systems</li>
          <li>Ground fault detection and fault isolation</li>
          <li>Power quality analysis and harmonics troubleshooting</li>
          <li>Alarm, monitoring, and controls systems</li>
          <li>Structured preventative maintenance programs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I later transitioned into large-scale energy commissioning, developing procedures,
          troubleshooting complex system faults, and supporting live operational deployments.
        </p>

        <p>
          What that means for marine clients is simple:
          I approach your vessel the same way critical infrastructure is approached —
          with discipline, documentation, and a focus on long-term reliability.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Marine?</h2>

        <p>
          Boats combine everything that makes electrical work challenging:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Vibration</li>
          <li>Moisture</li>
          <li>Corrosion</li>
          <li>Limited access</li>
          <li>Mixed AC/DC systems</li>
          <li>Add-on electronics layered over decades</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Most marine electrical issues are not caused by a single failed component —
          they are caused by incomplete installations, undocumented modifications,
          or cumulative small compromises.
        </p>

        <p>
          My goal is not just to fix the symptom.
          My goal is to restore clarity and confidence to your system.
        </p>

        <h2>What Clients Can Expect</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Methodical troubleshooting</li>
          <li>Clean, ABYC-aligned workmanship</li>
          <li>Clear documentation of work performed</li>
          <li>Practical recommendations, not upsells</li>
          <li>Long-term system thinking</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Whether it’s battery systems, charging architecture, power quality concerns,
          NMEA networks, or full system reviews — the approach remains the same:
        </p>

        <p><strong>Stability first. Simplicity second. Performance third.</strong></p>

        <h2>The Name “Sure Shot”</h2>

        <p>
          In complex systems, guessing creates failures.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sure Shot represents precision, accountability, and doing the job correctly the first time.
          Because when you leave the dock, your electrical system should not be something you worry about.
